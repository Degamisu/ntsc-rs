# Roadmap (in no particular order)

- Audio processing(?)
- Improve tracking noise and "snow" effect realism
- Node-based analog video effect GUI? The various functions for each part of the effect are very composable, and
  it would be nice to be able to apply them in any order. There's also potential for emulating analog video "glitch"
  effects and multiplexing them, as seen in e.g. [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQHocOLTxnw).
- Blender plugin
- Wave digital filters to more accurately model analog circuitry?
- Some sort of test suite so I don't have to test everything manually every time I touch the blitting code
